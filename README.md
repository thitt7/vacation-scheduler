## About The Project

This is a simple NodeJS project that leverages the Airtable API to create a streamlined process for requesting PTO/Vacation time at my place of employment. The
current way of accomodating these requests is entirely manual and the aim is to minimize the amount of manual data entry done by HR and simply reduce their role 
in the process to that of approving or denying the request. The project is composed of a few separate tables, one to store the request data submitted from the front-end by
employees, another that programmatically stores and updates employee data such as the amount of PTO left, date it resets, etc. and lastly a read-only public-facing
table that displays the data in a calendar view which serves as part of the company calendar alongside holidays, team meetings, and the like.
